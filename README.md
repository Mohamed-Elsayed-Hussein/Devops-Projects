# DevOps Projects Repository

This repository collects practical DevOps projects. Below is a list of current projects with a short description for each. The list will be expanded as new projects are added.

## Projects

- project1 — Three-tier application using Docker Compose:
  - Go backend connected to MySQL, auto-initializes database and seeds initial data.
  - Nginx reverse proxy with HTTPS (self-signed certificates for local development).
  - Isolated service networks and orchestration via Compose.

- project2 — DevOps-related project. Description will be updated later.

## Notes

- Each project contains its own README with steps to run and verify.
- Do not commit real secrets. Use local env files or secret stores.
- This list will be updated over time with new projects and improved descriptions.
